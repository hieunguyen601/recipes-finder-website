        <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>
          Help more people cook nourishing meals, more often. Healthy Recipe
          Finder was created to prove that healthy eating can be convenient,
          affordable, and genuinely delicious. We showcase quick, whole-food
          dishes that anyone can master—no fancy equipment, no ultra-processed
          shortcuts—just honest ingredients and straightforward steps.

        <h2>Why we exist</h2>

        <h3>Cut through the noise</h3>
        <p>
          The internet is bursting with recipes, yet most busy cooks still
          default to take-away or packaged foods. We curate a tight collection
          of fool-proof dishes so you can skip the scrolling and start cooking.
        </p>

        <h3>Empower home kitchens</h3>
        <p>
          When you control what goes into your meals, you control how you feel.
          Every recipe is built around unrefined ingredients and ready in about
          half an hour of active prep.
        </p>

        <h3>Make healthy look good</h3>
        <p>
          High-resolution imagery shows you exactly what success looks
          like—because we eat with our eyes first, and confidence matters.

        <h2>Our food philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Whole ingredients first:</strong> Fresh produce, grains,
            legumes, herbs, and quality fats form the backbone of every recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flavor without compromise:</strong> Spices, citrus, and
            natural sweetness replace excess salt, sugar, and additives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Respect for time:</strong> Weeknight meals should slot into
            real schedules; weekend cooking can be leisurely but never wasteful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sustainable choices:</strong> Short ingredient lists cut
            down on food waste and carbon footprint, while plant-forward dishes
            keep things planet-friendly.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="section beyond">
        <h2>Beyond the plate</h2>
        <p>
          We believe food is a catalyst for community and well-being. By sharing
          approachable recipes, we hope to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourage family dinners and social cooking.</li>
          <li>Reduce reliance on single-use packaging and delivery waste.</li>
          <li>Spark curiosity about seasonal produce and local agriculture.</li>
        </ul>
